# SelfCommit
## Phase 1: Planning
- My idea is to built a self tracking routine app that have the contribution activity like the GitHub system. But instead of coding and open source contribution, it is about contribution to ourselves. Users can track the activity or achievement that they had done or achieved each day.
- As for the section:
  1. Dashboard
  2. Activity
  3. Goals
  4. Settings
 
- Maybe for large scale, we can add features for interacting with other users. Adding group or community features also. Maybe login system.
- As for now, I want to try building small-scale project, which utilizes localStorage, like what I had done in my 'Quran Murajaah Tracker' project.
- But if I successfully completed the small-scale system, I don't know what is the next step. Do you have any suggestion? Or do you have any other plan or strategy that I can use to follow and improve?

What do you think?
